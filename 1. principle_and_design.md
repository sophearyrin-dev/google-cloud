**3 Types of Cloud Services**
- SaaS (Software as a Service) is like renting software online. Instead of buying and installing it on your computer, you use it through the internet. For example, apps like Gmail, Netflix, or Google Docs are SaaS—you just log in and start using them without needing to install or maintain anything
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) You rent the raw computing power (servers, storage, etc.) and set it up the way you want. Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) You get tools to build your own apps, but you don’t worry about the servers or setup. You write your app in Python, Java, or Node.js, and Google App Engine hosts and scales it automatically. You don’t manage the servers; you just focus on coding. Example: Google AppEngine, Heroku, Microsoft Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
